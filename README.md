# Clustering-with-Abalone-Dataset
Machine learning using Abalone dataset


Project:
Clustering of abalone data using the age of the abalones

Data Description:
The dataset used for the analysis is Abalone dataset which was downloaded from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone
The dataset contains various physical estimations regarding abalone samples as below:
1.	Sex (nominal variable) - Values are M (Male), F(Female), and I (infant)
2.	Length in mm (continuous variable) - Longest shell measurement 
3.	Diameter in mm (continuous variable) - perpendicular to length 
4.	Height in mm (continuous variable) - Height of the shell with meat inside
5.	Whole weight in grams (continuous variable) - whole abalone weight
6.	Shucked weight in grams (continuous variable) - weight of meat in the shell
7.	Viscera in grams (continuous variable) - gut weight of the shell (after bleeding)
8.	Shell weight in grams (continuous variable) - weight of the shell after being dried
9.	Rings (integer value) - when 1.5 is added to this value it gives the age in years of abalone
Total number of samples are 4177 with eight attributes. The aim of this data analysis is classification of the abalones according to their age and clustering the data.
